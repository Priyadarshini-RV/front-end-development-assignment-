<h1>Skincare Products</h1>

<p>I have had so many questions about my skincare and what products I use, that I have compiled my current skincare routine & how to layer products into a blog post for you. If your skin is in good shape, any makeup you apply on top of it will look much better. Good skin is key to flawless makeup application and I am pretty ocd about my skincare. I believe in a simple skincare routine without too many steps. That way, you are more likely to stick to it and will see results.</p>

<p>Skincare doesn’t have to be complicated to be effective. I believe in good quality products that work for your skin type, as well as consistency. Remember, a skincare product takes at least 6-8 weeks to start seeing results, with maximum results at around 18 months. So many people give up too quickly and have a drawer full of expensive skincare products that “didn’t work” because they simply weren’t given enough time to do their job.</p>
<p><b>DR. LORETTA GENTLE HYDRATING CLEANSER :</b> When I feel like a need a little extra something, I use this in the morning. I apply to dry skin, leave on 2-3 minutes and then splash warm water and wash my face. Leaves my skin clean and hydrated.</p>

<p><b>GARNIER MICELLAR WATER :</b>I have used this for years. I usually just go over my face with a cotton round saturated with this stuff to refresh my skin in the morning.</p>
